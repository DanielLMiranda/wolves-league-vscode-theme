<h1 align="center"><strong>Wolves League</strong> Visual Studio Code Theme</h1>

<h2 align="center">What is Wolves League?</h2>
<p align="center">Basically Wolves League is a brand. I created Wolves League initially to be a Discord server in which my friend and I would hang out and play games, and eventually invite new people to the server and create a community. But because of many things we never actually had the time to put effort to make Wolves League grow.</p>

<p align="center">Since the Discord server didn't work (yet), I've been using Wolves League as a brand. I created a logo and chose the colors, which is mostly shades of red for the logo and a dark grey background.</p>

<h2 align="center">Why I created a Vscode theme?</h2>
<p align="center">Well, why not? But to be more precise, I like to have an identity, I really like the color red and I want to have a bit of my personality in my Vscode, since I spend a lot of time in it, I might as well make it more confortable.</p>
<p align="center">Other than that, I think it's a good challenge to try to make something that I've never done before, and it's something that I can imediatelly take advantage of.</p>

<h2 align="center">Work in progress (WIP)</h2>
<p align="center">Since it's the first time I'm making a Vscode theme, it will take some time for me to understand every little piece of the editor and also for me to choose the colors that I like. But as soon as I think it is usable, I'll publish it in Vscode Marketplace</p>
